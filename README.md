# 🧠 Leivur’s Dev Blog

This is the personal blog of Leivur Gargiulo — an aspiring full-stack web developer learning in public, one post (and one bug) at a time.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and customized from the [astro-tech-blog template](https://astro-tech-blog-ten.vercel.app/), this blog is my little corner of the internet where I share what I’m learning, building, and occasionally breaking.

## ✍️ What You’ll Find Here

- My experience learning JavaScript, Python, and web dev from the ground up

- Occasional chaos and humor
