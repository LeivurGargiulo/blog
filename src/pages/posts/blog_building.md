Let’s be real: I could’ve just used a pre-made site builder, clicked a few buttons, and called it a day. But no — I wanted a challenge. I wanted to build something with code. So that’s how I ended up discovering **Astro**.

## 🪐 So, what *is* Astro?

Astro is a modern static site builder that caught my eye because of how fast and lightweight it is — plus, it plays nicely with Markdown and lets you mix frameworks if you want to. I had never used it before, but once I saw what it could do, I knew I wanted to build my blog with it.

I didn't want to start from scratch though (I’m brave, not reckless 😅), so I started looking for templates. After some GitHub/Google deep dives, I found this one:

👉 [astro-tech-blog-ten.vercel.app](https://astro-tech-blog-ten.vercel.app/)

Minimal, clean, developer-focused. Perfect.

## 🛠️ Customizing the Template

Once I cloned the repo, it was time to make it mine. I:

- Read through the **Astro docs** to understand how everything fit together  
- Went over the **template’s README** to learn how to change colors, layout, and content  
- Modified the **theme colors** to match my personal vibe  
- Rewrote the **intro content** and **posts** to reflect *my* journey  
- Played around until things stopped breaking (mostly)

It took me a couple of hours (and a few “why isn’t this working” moments), but I figured it out.

## 🎯 The End Result

This blog.

Is it 100% mine? No — credit where credit’s due, I’m building on the work of other devs who generously open-sourced their templates.  
But is it something I’m proud of? **Absolutely.**

I learned a ton just by poking around, trying things, and making small changes that helped me understand how the whole system works. I’ve never felt closer to both my code and my Google search history.

## 🚧 What’s Next?

Eventually, I want to create my *own* Astro theme from scratch — just to really test what I’ve learned. But for now, this blog works. It’s my space. And it’s only going to grow.

Stay tuned for more posts, more experiments, and more dev chaos.
