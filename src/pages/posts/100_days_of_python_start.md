After some intense soul-searching (and a lot of scrolling), I finally decided to start the **#100DaysOfCode Python** challenge by Dr. Angela Yu. Yup — the _Python arc_ has officially begun.

Why Python? Simple: it’s powerful, readable, and it opens a ton of doors, both for backend web dev and beyond. Plus, let’s be real — the syntax is kind of a dream after years of CSS frustration. It’s like:

```python
if learning_is_fun:
  keep_going()
```

I’m currently on **Day 5** as I write this, and I’ve already built:

*   A **Band Name Generator** (hello, goofy side projects 👀)
    
*   A **Tip Calculator** (I now fear decimals slightly less)
    
*   A **Treasure Island game** (my first if/else tree, and no pirates were harmed)
    
*   A **Rock Paper Scissors game** (my logic muscles got a workout)
    
*   A **Password Generator** (might’ve created some monster passwords ngl)
    

Each day adds just enough challenge to keep me thinking without overwhelming me. And even when I _am_ overwhelmed, I can go back, rewatch, and rebuild — which is exactly what I need as a neurodivergent learner trying to make sense of code one block at a time.

I’m keeping the whole journey open source here:👉 [My GitHub repo](https://github.com/LeivurGargiulo/100DaysOfCodePython)

So if you want to peek at my code, copy it, remix it, or just see what Day 17 me does compared to Day 5 me — go for it. I’m doing this to **build consistency**, **solidify logic**, and honestly… to prove to myself that I _can_ finish something this big.

Let’s see where Python takes me.
