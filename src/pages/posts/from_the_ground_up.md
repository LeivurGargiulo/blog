Hey! Iâ€™m Leivur, and this is the beginning of my dev journey â€” or at least, the part where I start documenting it.

Right now, Iâ€™m an aspiring full-stack web developer building my foundation one step (and one bug) at a time. My roots are in HTML and CSS â€” the structure and style â€” but Iâ€™ve recently started diving deeper into the logic behind the scenes with JavaScript and Python. Thatâ€™s where the magic happens, and also where my brain occasionally short-circuits. But thatâ€™s part of the fun.

Iâ€™m not claiming to have it all figured out (not even close). This blog isnâ€™t a highlight reel â€” itâ€™s a sandbox. A place where Iâ€™ll share what Iâ€™m learning, what Iâ€™m building, and probably what Iâ€™ve broken along the way. My approach is simple: learn by doing. Iâ€™m building small, practical projects that help me understand not just how things work, but why they do.

Iâ€™m also experimenting with tools like Astro to bring my ideas to life â€” and maybe even make them look good while Iâ€™m at it. Clean code, clean interfaces, and a clean(er) desktop are the goals. One of those is optional.

If you're learning too, or just curious about how someone goes from HTML noob to (hopefully) full-stack pro, youâ€™re in the right place. Letâ€™s figure it out together. No gatekeeping, no pretending, just growth.

This is Day 1. Letâ€™s build something cool.
